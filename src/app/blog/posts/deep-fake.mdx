# ü§ñ Hybrid Deepfake Detection System with Telegram Bot Integration

Welcome to the deepfake detection project‚Äîan intelligent tool designed to help users identify manipulated videos using AI, delivered through a convenient Telegram bot interface. This system merges powerful deep learning techniques with user accessibility to combat the spread of misinformation.

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. **Hybrid Detection Model**
- Combines **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for analyzing spatial features in frames.
- Utilizes **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks to detect temporal inconsistencies across sequences of frames.
- Improves accuracy compared to using standalone models.

### 2. **Telegram Bot Integration**
- Users can upload video files directly via Telegram.
- The bot processes the video, detects possible deepfakes, and returns a clear authenticity result.
- Easy-to-use, with no technical expertise required.

### 3. **Core Functionalities**
- Extracts frames from uploaded videos using OpenCV.
- Preprocesses data and runs it through the hybrid model in real-time.
- Delivers responses via Telegram chat, providing immediate feedback.
- Modular setup allows easy scaling or migration to web platforms in the future.

## üß† AI Architecture & Model Design

The model is built to handle both spatial and temporal analysis for accurate classification:

- **CNN Architecture**: Trained to identify visual anomalies in individual video frames.
- **LSTM Layer**: Captures sequence-based inconsistencies that typically occur in deepfake videos.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Automates frame extraction, resizing, and normalization.

Training is done on publicly available deepfake datasets and fine-tuned for real-world performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Bot & Backend Stack

The Telegram bot acts as a bridge between the user and the AI system:

- **Telegram Bot API**: Handles media uploads, command parsing, and message replies.
- **Python Backend**: Manages video processing, model inference, and result formatting.
- **OpenCV**: Used for real-time video frame extraction and analysis.
- **NumPy/Pandas**: Helps handle and preprocess frame data efficiently.

## üß™ Testing & Evaluation

- Accuracy: Model expected to perform with over **80% accuracy** based on training and validation sets.
- Performance: Optimized to process short videos in **under 30 seconds** depending on device capabilities.
- UX: Designed for non-technical users with clear bot commands and easy feedback mechanisms.
