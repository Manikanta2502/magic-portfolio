## Overview

The Currency Converter Chrome Extension transforms your web browsing by instantly converting currency values into your chosen currency — right within the page. Designed for global users including travelers, researchers, and online shoppers, the extension detects over 150 currencies, supports mixed formats, and understands both Western (K/M/B) and Indian (Lakhs, Crores) numeric systems.

It leverages intelligent regex-based parsing and real-time exchange rates to provide seamless, clear and neat conversions for highlighted text, input fields, and even dynamically loaded content. The extension aims to bring financial clarity to international browsing with a single click.

## Key Features

* **Live Currency Conversion**: Converts values like `$500`, `€2M` into your preferred currency using real-time rates from the Frankfurter API.
* **Dynamic Content Support**: Detects currency values even on JavaScript-heavy or AJAX-powered pages using `MutationObserver`.
* **Indian & Global Format Recognition**: Supports Lakhs/Crores along with abbreviations like K (Thousand), M (Million), and B (Billion).
* **Input & Highlight Conversion**: Auto-converts values inside input fields and supports highlight-to-convert for manual selections.
* **User Preferences**: Users can select default currency, toggle conversion formats, and save settings via `chrome.storage.sync`.

## Technologies Used

* **JavaScript & Regex**: For parsing and detecting currency patterns in DOM text and input fields.
* **Chrome Extensions API**: For background task handling, script injection, and persistent settings.
* **Exchange Rate API**: Provides accurate daily exchange rates with fallback support for offline use.
* **MutationObserver**: Enables detection of changes in DOM (like SPA updates or AJAX calls).
* **HTML, Tailwind CSS**: Builds a clean, responsive popup interface for currency selection and configuration.

## Challenges and Learnings

Developing a robust parser that could handle edge cases like `€1.2M`, `₹2.5L` required precise regex handling and a deep understanding of number localization. Managing conversions inside dynamic single-page apps (SPAs) led to the use of `MutationObserver` for real-time DOM updates. Another challenge was balancing performance with real-time detection across large or frequently updating pages.

This project improved my skills in browser scripting, Chrome extension lifecycle, storage APIs, and international number formatting strategies.

## Outcome

The extension has become a powerful tool for instantly understanding foreign currency values across the web. It now supports 150+ currencies for detection and converts over 50 actively, while adapting to both Western and Indian formatting standards. It's feature-rich yet lightweight, with future enhancements planned for multi-currency mode, trend visualizations, and historical rate access.

This project blends usability with technical precision, helping users bridge global pricing with local relevance—directly within the browser.
