## Overview
This project presents a hybrid deep learning approach leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for spatial analysis and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal consistency to enhance deepfake detection accuracy. Deepfake technology, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence, enables the creation of highly realistic manipulated videos, posing significant threats to security, privacy, and misinformation. The proposed model offers a robust and scalable solution for deepfake detection, contributing to the fight against digital media manipulation and misinformation.
